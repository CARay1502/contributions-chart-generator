# üõ†Ô∏è Setup

## üñºÔ∏è GUI Version (Recommended)

> üí° Prefer a point-and-click interface? Use `gui.py`!

The GUI version lets you configure the script visually with:
- Input fields for GitHub repo, email, commit range, and more
- Git branch selection
- Scrollable live log output to monitor progress
- A ‚ÄúRun Script‚Äù button to launch the automation

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use the GUI

1. Download this repository to your machine. 
2. Ensure you have Python and Git installed on your machine.
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python gui.py
```

### üíª CLI Version 

### 1. Create a Public Repository

Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a **public** repo (e.g. `github-activity`).  
Do not initialize it with a README.

---

### 2. Configure the Script

Clone this repo or copy `contribute.py` into your working directory.  
Then edit the top of the script to match your info:

```python
GITHUB_REPO = "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-activity.git"  # change this to repo url
LOCAL_REPO = "temp-repo" #leave or change to any name you want
USER_NAME = "YOUR_USERNAME"  # change this 
USER_EMAIL = "your.email@example.com"  # change this
```

### 3. Run it 

Open a terminal and run:

```python
python contribute.py
```

‚úÖ If everything is configured correctly:

A new folder (temp-repo) will be created

Commits will be made with backdated timestamps

All commits will be pushed to GitHub

üïí Wait a few minutes, then check your GitHub profile to see the new green squares on your contributions chart!

### Troubleshooting

If you get an error first make sure that your github username and email are configured correctly on your local machine: 

Use git config command to configure email and name. 
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com" #replace with github profile email
```

If this does not work, consult ChatGPT like I did. Good luck!
